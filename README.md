Special thanks to [B3LYP](https://github.com/pawREP), for his many contributions to the speedrunning community:  
- writing the initial MIGT code injection for Elden Ring.  
- writing the original Sekiro plugin, which features have been included  
- OG ds3 plugin, together with [Jiiks](https://github.com/Jiiks/)  

Thanks Pav, for the Elden Ring cheat engine table.  
Thanks [Johndisandonato](https://github.com/veeenu), pretty much always willing to exhange some ideas about tech stuff  
[Yapped](https://github.com/vawser/Yapped-Rune-Bear) helped speed up mapping event flags to bosses and graces

Thanks [Blade](https://github.com/bladecoding/DarkSouls3RemoveIntroScreens) for the nologo code!  

I use Clion and Resharper from jetbrains to develop SoulSplitter. They have been giving me a free opensource license to use all their products for non-comercial use for a couple years now. Totally awesome, thanks Jetbrains!

# build

The .net build relies on some local files, all can be obtained by cloning livesplit.  

Building soulinjectee can be done in the root directory of the repository. You can build it for 32 bit (DS1 PTDE & DS2 vanilla) or for 64 bit (all other soulsgames) - you need the right toolchain/target for each build respectively  
64 bit: `cargo build --lib`  
32 bit: `cargo build --lib --target=i686-pc-windows-msvc`
